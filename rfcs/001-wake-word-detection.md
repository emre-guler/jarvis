# RFC 001: Wake Word Detection System

## Priority Tier: P0 (Critical Path)
Implementation Order: 1

## Overview
This RFC proposes the implementation of the wake word detection system for Jarvis, which serves as the primary activation mechanism for the AI assistant.

     - Multiple "Jarvis" utterances
     - Various tones and speeds
     - Different environmental conditions
   - Negative samples:
     - Similar-sounding words
     - Common background noises
     - Typical user commands

#### Phase 3: Optimization
