# RFC 007: Security Framework

## Priority Tier: P1 (High Priority)
Implementation Order: 7

## Overview
This RFC outlines the comprehensive security framework that ensures the protection of user data, system integrity, and secure operation of all Jarvis components.

## Background
Security is paramount for an AI assistant with system-level access. The security framework must protect against unauthorized access, ensure data privacy, and maintain system integrity while allowing legitimate operations to proceed smoothly.

## Motivation
- Protect user data and privacy
- Prevent unauthorized access
- Secure system operations
- Maintain audit trails
- Ensure compliance with regulations
