# RFC 004: AI Integration System

## Priority Tier: P1 (High Priority)
Implementation Order: 4

## Overview
This RFC details the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and other AI components to power Jarvis's understanding and response generation capabilities.

## Background
The AI integration system serves as the brain of Jarvis, enabling natural language understanding, context awareness, and intelligent response generation. It needs to work seamlessly with voice input/output systems while maintaining high performance and accuracy.
