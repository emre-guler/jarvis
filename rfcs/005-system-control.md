# RFC 005: System Control Interface

## Priority Tier: P1 (High Priority)
Implementation Order: 5

## Overview
This RFC outlines the implementation of the system control interface that enables Jarvis to interact with and control the host computer system through voice commands.

## Background
The system control interface is crucial for enabling Jarvis to execute system commands, manage applications, and control computer functions through voice commands, making it a key component for hands-free computer control.

## Motivation
- Enable voice-controlled computer operations
- Provide hands-free system management
- Automate common tasks
- Improve accessibility
- Streamline workflow
