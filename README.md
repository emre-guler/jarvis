# Jarvis AI Assistant

A sophisticated AI-powered personal assistant inspired by Iron Man's JARVIS, featuring voice recognition, AI interaction, system control, and personalized information services.

> **Note:** This project was architected and designed with the assistance of AI (Claude 3.5 Sonnet by Anthropic). The entire system architecture, including RFCs, documentation, and technical specifications, was carefully crafted to create a personal voice assistant inspired by J.A.R.V.I.S. from the Iron Man movies. The project aims to demonstrate the potential of modern AI technologies in creating sophisticated personal assistants.
